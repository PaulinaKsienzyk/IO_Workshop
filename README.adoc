Let's refresh some information about inputs and outputs. Let them prepare you for the next workshops, the level of which we
will slightly raise!

.Agenda
. File and directory.
. Simple Scanner.
. Writing object to the file.

NOTE: Now we look at the package java.io. If you want to know more, see https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J5b_IO.html

CAUTION: Beaware for exceptions. Handle them, don't leave `e.printStackTrace ()`!

Enjoy!.
